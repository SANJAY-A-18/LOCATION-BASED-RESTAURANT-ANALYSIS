# 🍽️ Location-Based Restaurant Analysis 🌍

## 📌 Objective
The objective of this project is to perform a **geographical analysis of restaurants**
using latitude and longitude information.  
The analysis focuses on understanding restaurant distribution, city-wise
concentration, and location-based trends in ratings and pricing.

---

## 🧠 What This Project Does
- Visualizes restaurant locations on an interactive map
- Analyzes restaurant concentration across different cities
- Computes city-wise statistics such as:
  - Number of restaurants
  - Average restaurant rating
  - Average cost for two
- Extracts meaningful insights from location-based data
